## About Project

ML enabled android application which will calculate the body fat %age and will recommend workout and diet.

Calculating Body fat % is an easy task but there is no fixed formula for calculating body density. Heres a ML model which uses a regression model built using tensorflow Which takes 8 inputs of different body measurements and gives the body density as an output which in turn calculates body fat %age. This is integrated in an android app



**Tech stack**:
Android Studio
Python
SQLite
Tensorflow keras API

 

## Use Cases of your project
Calculating body density is a very difficult job, not accessible to everyone, in a society which is trying its best to assess itself and take necessary actions to improve its lifestyle.
This app helps to find the body density and in turn the fat %age easily by taking 8 inputs of different body measurements
This can also be used as a personal fitness app which can track the fat percentage with time
